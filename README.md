# IndexedDB-as-Storage-in-NWJS

This takes the window object from the nwjs context and puts it into a node module to use IndexedDB, with or without a Worker, in node context places. This lets comes with several advantages:
* You can use your database in a non-nwjs context (once it is initialized in a nwjs context)
* Asynchronous
* Non-blocking when used in a worker (db-sw.js isntead of db.js)
* Can store keys other than strings (see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm)
* Wraps IndexedDB into a Storage-like API: setItem, getItem, removeItem, clear, and length (key may be implemented later)
* Is faster than pouchDB because of a very simple IndexedDB implementation (according to http://nolanlawson.github.io/database-comparison/)

You need a recent-ish version of NW.js to run this. No clue if it will work in versions older than 0.14.7.

## Example app

Get all the files in this repository and run it with nw.js (put into a package.nw folder, put into the base directory of nw.exe, etc).

If you have 0.12.3 or the SDK version of a more recent NW.js downloaded, open the console to see the status of the sharedWorker inserts. It takes significantly longer to use a sharedWorker than the standard (blocking) IndexedDB operations, as in 0.1ms or less vs 4-5ms when doing a lot of operations at the same time, but it's only about 2ms vs 4-5ms for a single operation. 

But you'll note that the setItem async (non-worker) operation *does* block the DOM with enough setItem operations (100,000 or so).  

Sync operations aren't actually synchronous, they're just doing the test where setItem is called, and when it finishes it runs the next setItem. Async just runs all the setItems immediately and handles them as they are finished. You can chnge the number of runs in app.html.

Overall, I'd recommend db-sw.js over db.js because of the small actual performance penalty and the non-blocking nature of workers.

## Usage

`let db = require('./db.js')` or `let db = require('./db-sw.js')`

`db.init(window, err => { /* do something when done */ })`
You *need* to call init(window) from a nwjs context, but it only needs to be done once due to module caching in node.js. That means you can do something like `require('./db.js').init(window)` at the beginning of your app, then require it later in modules or in any other context and use it.

`db.setItem(key, value, err => { if (err) console.error(err) })`

`db.getItem(key, (res, err) => { err ? console.error(err) : console.log(res) })`

`db.removeItem(key, err => { if (err) console.error(err) })`

`db.clear(err => {if (err) console.log(err) })`

`db.length((res, err) => { err ? console.error(err) : console.log(res) })`

## Random notes

`db.transaction(['data'], 'readwrite').objectStore('data')` is the biggest time sink and the reason why the Worker implementation is slower in large numbers of quick transactions. The transaction won't stay open for long enough to take multiple operations before it finishes, while in the non-worker implementation, it does stay open.

There really isn't any good sharedWorker documentation that I could find. 

If you create too many webWorkers, you can crash nw.js. Luckily, only once instance of sharedWorker is made.
